Subject: dt-bindings: power/supply: Add ltc4162-l-charger

Add support for the LTC4162-L Li-Ion battery charger. The driver allows
reading back telemetry and to set some charging options like the input
current limit.

This adds the devicetree bindings.

+description: |
+  The LTC Â® 4162-L is an advanced monolithic synchronous step-down switching
+  battery charger and PowerPath (TM) manager that seamlessly manages power
+  distribution between input sources such as wall adapters, backplanes, solar
+  panels, etc., and a rechargeable Lithium-Ion/Polymer battery.
